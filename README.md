# JavaScript-Quiz
A short JavaScript Quiz

I created this short, 5 question quiz based on what I have learned so far during the Full Stack Development Track at Treehouse. 

Just answer the 5 simple question in the prompt and the computer will tell you if you were correct, or not. Then at the end of the game the computer will let you know how many correct answers you got, and give you your award. 

The answers are not case-sensitive.
